    <h1>Clauses</h1>
    <p>In English, clauses are groups of words containing a subject and a predicate. 
        Clauses can be divided into two main types: independent clauses and dependent clauses.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Independent Clauses:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: Can stand alone as a complete sentence because they express a complete thought.</li>
            <li>Example: <em>She went to the market.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Dependent Clauses:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: Cannot stand alone as a sentence because they do not express a complete thought. They depend on an independent clause for meaning.</li>
            <li>Examples: <em>Because she was late...</em>, <em>When the rain stopped...</em></li>
            <li>Types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Relative Clauses: A type of dependent clause introduced by relative pronouns like <em>who</em>, <em>whom</em>, <em>whose</em>, <em>which</em>, <em>that</em>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <em>The book that I borrowed is fascinating.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Conditional Clauses: Describe conditions and often use <em>if</em> or <em>unless</em>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <em>If it rains, we will stay indoors.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Comparative Clauses: Express comparisons and are often introduced by <em>than</em> or <em>as</em>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <em>She is taller than her brother.</em></li>
                </ul>

    <h1>Active and Passive Voice</h1>
    <p>In English grammar, voice refers to the form of a verb that indicates whether the subject performs the action (active voice) or receives the action (passive voice).</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Active Voice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: The subject performs the action of the verb.</li>
            <li>Structure: <strong>Subject + Verb + Object</strong>.</li>
            <li>Example: <em>The cat chased the mouse.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Passive Voice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: The subject receives the action of the verb.</li>
            <li>Structure: <strong>Object + Form of "to be" + Past Participle + (by + Subject)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Example: <em>The mouse was chased by the cat.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Key Differences:</li>
        <ul>

                    <li>Passive Voice: Focuses on the recipient of the action.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use Cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Active Voice: Preferred in most writing for clarity and directness.</li>
                    <li>Passive Voice: Used when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or needs to be de-emphasized. Example: <em>The report was completed on time.</em></li>

    <h1>Direct and Indirect Speech</h1>
    <p>In English grammar, speech can be reported in two ways: direct speech and indirect (or reported) speech. They are used to convey what someone has said.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Direct Speech:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: The exact words spoken by someone are quoted, usually enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
            <li>Structure: <strong>Subject + Reporting Verb + Quotation Marks (" ") + Exact Words</strong>.</li>
            <li>Example: <em>He said, "I am going to the market."</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Indirect Speech:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition: The words spoken by someone are reported without quoting their exact words, often involving a change in tense and pronouns.</li>
            <li>Structure: <strong>Subject + Reporting Verb + That (optional) + Reported Clause</strong>.</li>
            <li>Example: <em>He said that he was going to the market.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Key Differences:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Quotation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct Speech: Uses quotation marks.</li>
                    <li>Indirect Speech: Does not use quotation marks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Changes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pronouns: May change to suit the context. Example: <em>He said, "I am tired."</em> → <em>He said that he was tired.</em></li>
                    <li>Tense: Usually shifts back. Example: Present → Past.</li>
                    <li>Time and Place: Words like *now* may change to *then*. Example: <em>"I will go tomorrow."</em> → <em>He said he would go the next day.</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use Cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct Speech: Useful for exact quotes or dramatic effect.</li>
                    <li>Indirect Speech: Useful for summarizing or reporting what was said.</li>
